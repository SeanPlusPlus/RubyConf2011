TDD
  - Test
  - Fix
  - Refactor
  - Repeat
  - Challenges for CLI Apps
    - tend to be implemented on production!
    - can screw up machine where it is designed to run on
    - with web you have dev server and prod server
  - Demo
    - Maintain our dotfiles
    - git repo with .bashrc .vimrc etc
    $ mkdir fullstop      #NO
    $ bundle gem fullstop #MAYBE
    $ methadone fullstop  #YES - his custom comamnd
    - Set up Aruba and cucumber
    - Cucumber steps for command line:
      Feature: Install my dotfiles
        In order to set up a new user account ...
      Scenario: Symlink my dotfiles
        ###
    - Personal Note: check out cucumber
    - This should variablize home dir to test elsewhere:
    $ cd /Users/dave && git clone /tmp/dotfiles dotfile
    - Testable units are good
  - Conclusions
    - Start with a template for command line apps (like methadone)
    - Start from outside in (use cucumber)
    - Once it gets complicated add unit tests
    - Design for testability
