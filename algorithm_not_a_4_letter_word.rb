Hard work is the secret sauce.

Overview of various Maze Algorithms
  - Drunken Walk
  - Sidewinder
  - Hunt and Kill
  - Recursive Backtracker
  - Recursive Division Algorithm
    - Divide and conquer
    - Split in half, create passage
  - Kruskals
    - Find spanning tree with lowest cost
    - Random spanning tree
    - most well-suited for over/under maze
  - Prims
    - Creates minimum spanning tree from graph
    - chooses starting pt adds to spanning tree adds neighbors to frontier
    - then marks visited sub neighbor til no more frontier cells
    - like 'setting piece of paper on fire'
  - Growing Tree
    - speaker's favorite
    - start at node
    - look at adjacent neighbor
    - if node has no unvisited adjacent neighbors, remove from active set
    - fuses algorithms: random walk and recursive backtracker
    - can split with oldest / newest and other algos
  - Growing Binary Tree Algorithm
    - what if you chose 2 adjacent neighbors and add them to active set?
    - whew!

Moral: hard work!
  - Look for the resistance
  - Day jobs not enough resistance
  - What you do every day, is exactly that
  - Find time for homework!
