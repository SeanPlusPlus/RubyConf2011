Making pictures by hand easy, but:
  - doesn't scale.
  - data changes frequently
  - different ppl want different things

Graphviz
  - Simple language to describe graphs
  - Tulip is an alternative, handles bigger sets

$ sudo gem install graph

  digraph do
    node("B").label "Hello"
  end

  digraph do
    edge "A", "B"
    save "example", "jpg"
  end

  digraph do
    boxes
    edge "A", "B"
    edge "B", "C"
  end

  digraph do
    node_attribs << red
    edge_attribs << blue
    edge "A", "B", "C"
  end

  - also supports: http://colorbrewer2.com
  - clustering also cool
    - apps on servers
    - things in diff depts
