This stuff is difficult!
  - Many things to do to improve process though
  - Talk today more about process than specific tool

How they work at github
  - asynchronously
    - 'you can do shit without needing to pull me out of the zone'
    - this can't be forced
    - no meetings
    - no deadlines: if it's done it's done
    - ignore pings: don't expect response, constant disruptions pain!
  - chat rooms: everything is logged
  - time flexibility

Pull Request + Branching
  - master > deploy3 > deploy6
  - often this model:
    - a shop has trusted and shitty developpers
    - trusted devs get master branch
    - shitty devs get their own forks
    - trusted devs have to check the shitty devs work in
  * Keep Your Branch Simple
  - How github does it
    - Master > Your Own Branch > Repeat
    - everyone can push and everyone can deploy
    - frees up from micro mananging
    - Master is Alway deployable
    - good b/c they deploy 10-40 times a day
    - let designers deploy
  - Keep Your Branches Simple
  - Pull Requests!
    - Central part of asynchronous world
    - this is code review!
    - ACTUALLY: Master > Your Branch > Pull Request > Repeat
    - Don't need to fork anything
    - Can run tests on something other than master
    - email is your interface
    - dsigners can evolve mockups and entire workflows
    - non-technical peeps get invovled
    - historical
    - can be experiments
    - you can throw it away
    - Mix Designers and Devs
    - Post Screenshots

Issues
  - the issue tracker: Title and Description
  - can you work better on simple tools
  - Merlin Mann email priorities
    - if it were really important it would be already done
    - ppl will do the important stuff if it needs to be done first
  - resist meta work
    - not actual work
    - just assigning labels
  - Categories:
   - Shit is Broken
   - Hey this would be Cool
   - ToDo List

oauth as identity
  - Ruby is fast
  - easy to build cool stuff for the heck of it
  - github has crap ton of apps
  - github as identification
  - sinatra_auth_github

hooks and hubot
  - campfire robot
  - has 275 commands
  - can deploy, play music, build graphs, mustaches images posted in chat
  - gets ppl involved
  - built in node.js
  - think about automating your own process
  - ex: ask 'what hasn't been deployed' - bot can answer this
  - ex: ask 'how many issues did we close out today' - answers this too

Moral: can you refine your process to make things simpler?
       constantly re-evaluate what you are doing wrong and how to improve.
