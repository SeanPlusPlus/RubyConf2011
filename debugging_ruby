1.9 is the future, 1.8 is dead

Profiling Tools
  - ruby-prof
  - perftools.rb
  - memprof

CPU Profiling
  - what parts of your code take lots of time
  - rb_add_event_hook(event_handler ...)

Perftools.rb
  - based on google perftools
  - sampling profiler
    - takes samples and gives you data based on that
  - how to find bottlenecks in RoR app
    $ be rails -s production
    $ curl -o bar_rails.gic "localhost..."
    - generates real slick looking graph
  * Personal Note: look into this

ruby-prof

objspace
  - count_object_size
  - count_nodes
  - count_tdata_objects

memprof
  - hooks into rb_newobl add_freelist
  - traces that can be added to any C function call
  - no new development tho
  - dumps heap/stack JSON
  - can run on 1.9 but need to hack
