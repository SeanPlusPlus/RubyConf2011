Integrated System Environment
  - A Ruby product
  - Built at Lockheed Virtual Systems Integration Lab
  - how to integrate 'walled garden'
  - an enablement layer
  - like a translation layer
  - used to develop simulations
  - air and missile defense stuff
  - how does it work?
    - RDBMS: job configs, executions, etc.
    - distributed file system
    - Peer: loads diff libraries

Lessons Learned From Development
  - Automate backups
  - Manage the configuration
    - more than just source
    - machines and vms
  - No programmer is an island
  - Continuous integration
    - commit often
    - test often
    - communicate always
  - Shared Vision Softens Conflicts
    - if 2 ppl have 2 diff ideas, bad product
    - shared vision
  - Time is Relative
    - don't be afraid to throw away code and refactor
    - taking a wk or month to refactor often saves time
  - Ruby Can Do (Almost) Anything
  - Never Surprise Management
    - if you are gonna be late, tell management!
    - let em know if you are gonna be early, tell 'em!
  - It's not Wrong, It's a Prototype
  - Celebrate When You Get It Right
