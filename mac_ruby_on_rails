MacRuby
  - unique blend of Ruby 1.9 and Obj C
  - Structure of Ruby 1.9:
    - Application > Ruby 1.9 (LLVM, Std Libs) > Sys Libraries > OS (Linux, Win, Mac)
  - Structure of MacRuby:
    - Application > MacRuby (Auto Zone, Foundation, Std Libs) > Sys Libs > Mac OS X
  - Current Status
    - #860 MacRuby abborted if you use catch throw inside rescue clause
    - and now Macruby only pops exception when necessary

RoR on MacRuby
  $ macruby --version
